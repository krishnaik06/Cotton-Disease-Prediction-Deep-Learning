# Cotton-Disease-Prediction-Deep-Learning
 
 This project leverages the visual features of cotton plants/leaves inorder to classify them into 4 categories.

 This project presents a cotton leaf disease classification algorithm that leverages these distinct appearances and advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning. 

 resnet(pre-existing model) is used in order to attain the result.

**#TRAINING**

 The model will be trained over different train-test splits to better understand the amount of image data needed to apply deep learning for such classification tasks.

 **#TESTING**

 The provided inputs are tested against the standard trained inputs and the most related condition output is displayed.

 The requirements are to be installed inorder to run the project.
 
** #INSTALLATION**
 
 pip install requirements.txt
